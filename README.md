# About The Shoulders of Giants
In 1676, Isaac Newton, one of the most influential mathematicians and scientists of all time, famously wrote:

> "If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."

The Shoulders of Giants, Inc. (TSoG) is a nonprofit (501(c)(3)) organization founded in 2013 on a vision that world-class science education should be available to all students of all ages. Since 2015, The Shoulders of Giants has offered an immersive, ongoing mentorship program for dedicated students who would like the opportunity to study more closely under the guidance of Dr. Steven J. Foland. This program is designed to provide middle and high school students with a broad foundation of knowledge and skills across science and engineering disciplines, experience working and communicating in a professional environment, and helps them develop the study habits necessary to achieve success at the university level and beyond.

In 2019, this world-class program became available to students everywhere with the launch of TSoG.tv. This online platform, created in collaboration between The Shoulders of Giants, Inc. and its sister-company Floating Point Laboratories, LLC, provides at-home exercises, live-streaming, and project support to students anywhere in the world.

## About Work in Progress
Work in Progress (WiP) is the main Kepler-level (high school) series on TSoG.tv, focused on multi-disciplinary engineering and applied science.

As the late, great astrophysicist and science advocate Carl Sagan once said: "If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe." With that great quote in mind, this is a series where we bake the whole pie. In each season of Work in Progress we propose a practical project, lay out specifications, then discuss all of the relevant background knowledge necessary to take that project to completion.

Episodes of WiP air live on www.twitch.tv/tsogtv and are archived at www.youtube.com/tsogtv. This project is based on the work completed in episodes that aired on Monday evenings in Summer 2019.

# Laser CT Scanner
## History and Motivation

## Current State
As the name of the series implies, this redesign is currently a work in progress. This section of the README will be kept up-to-date with the current state of the project as the season progresses.

### Design Inputs
* Should function as closely in general operation to an actual CT scanner as possible.
* At least 1 motorized D.O.F.
* Must be able to independently capture a full 2D slice of an opaque object.
* Must be able to transmit raw data to a computer.
* Must be able to adjust height / z-axis of scan on object (manually or otherwise).

### Stretch Goals
* Able to image semi-opaque materials.
* Scanner rotates around subject rather than rotating the subject.
* Motorized z-axis.

### How to Collaborate
For any active TSoG.tv students who would like to contribute to this project, please create a GitHub account and contact Dr. Foland via Discord. He will need your GitHub username to grant you permission to modify this repository.

This project includes mechanical CAD that we will be completing in Alibre Design. You can download a 30 day trial of this software [here](https://www.alibre.com/get-a-trial-of-alibre-design-expert/). Students active on this project should discuss longer-term licensing options with Dr. Foland.

This project also includes electricad CAD that we will be completing in KiCAD. You can download this open source software [here](http://www.kicad.org/).
